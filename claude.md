## üí° How to Help with This Project

### When Asked About Status
1. Reference the HTML tracker (31 items)
2. Focus on CRITICAL priority items first (4 items)
3. Check completion percentage from dashboard
4. Identify blockers

### When Asked to Build/Modify Features
1. **Always ask:** "Is this related to one of the 31 criteria?"
2. **Priority order:**
   - CRITICAL items ‚Üí High items ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low
3. **Keep it simple:** This is for beginners
4. **Test locally first:** Use HTML file, not complex builds

### When Asked About Technical Implementation
**Current Stack:**
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js/Next.js
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- AI Engine: Vitraya proprietary (black box to us)
- Hosting: Cloud infrastructure

**Key Technical Challenges:**
- Invoice digitization accuracy
- Savings calculation methodology
- Provider document upload compliance
- API performance and reliability

## üîç Common Questions & Answers

### "What's the most important thing right now?"
**Answer:** Achieving 90% adjudication accuracy by October 7, 2025. Everything else is secondary.

### "Which criteria are CRITICAL?"
**Answer:** 4 items:
1. Invoice amount precedence (LCT ‚Üí ETIMS ‚Üí Document)
2. Tariff and price validation
3. Repeated service detection
4. Cross-provider duplicate service detection

### "What's the FinTech opportunity?"
**Answer:**
- Providers currently wait 60 days for payment
- New model: Pay in 24 hours
- Providers discount 10-15% for fast payment
- LCT still pays in 60 days = arbitrage opportunity
- Needs 250M KES working capital

### "Why are they still in pilot?"
**Answer:**
- Quality concerns from LCT
- Need consistent 90%+ accuracy proven
- Until then = no commercial billing = no revenue
- October 2025 is make-or-break month

### "What's the addressable market?"
**Immediate:** 1B KES (11 LCT-controlled schemes)
**Medium-term:** 1.5B KES (Liaison Group partnership)
**Long-term:** 4.5B KES (corporate self-funded schemes)
**Massive:** Entire Kenya insurance industry transformation

## üéØ Key Success Metrics (Remember These)

### Quality Metrics
- **Target:** 90%+ adjudication accuracy
- **Current:** Improving but not commercial-ready
- **Measurement:** Correct approve/reject vs manual review

### Financial Performance
- **Savings:** 19.8% average across schemes
- **Volume:** 847 claims/week (trending up)
- **Top Scheme:** MTRH at 19.8% savings

### Fraud Detection
- **Example Case:** CB-109764-25
  - Provider billed: 1,700 KES
  - Documents showed: 3,370 KES
  - AI detected: 98.2% variance
  - Decision: Rejected (billing anomaly)

---

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For

### Business Red Flags
- Any discussion of billing before 90% quality achieved
- Pressure to scale before proving MTRH success
- Skipping documentation requirements
- Provider resistance to document uploads

### Technical Red Flags
- Hardcoded values instead of tariff validation
- Missing fraud detection patterns
- Incomplete vetting per invoice
- No savings tracking by service type

### User Experience Red Flags
- Complex interfaces for non-technical users
- Requiring manual data entry that could be automated
- No export/backup functionality
- Missing status tracking

---

## üîß Development Guidelines

### For Beginners (Small Steps Approach)
1. **Start with HTML file** - No build process needed
2. **One feature at a time** - Don't try to do everything
3. **Test in browser** - Open HTML, make change, refresh
4. **Save often** - LocalStorage is your friend
5. **Export regularly** - CSV backup of your progress
6. **Let Sentinel review** - Commit often to get automated feedback

### Code Style
- **Keep it readable** - Comments for complex logic
- **Use simple names** - `status` not `sts`, `criteria` not `crit`
- **Avoid nested loops** - Flatten when possible
- **One responsibility** - Each function does ONE thing
- **Security first** - Never hardcode secrets, validate all inputs

### Testing Approach
```javascript
// Good: Test one criteria at a time
function testInvoiceValidation() {
  const result = validateInvoice(testData);
  console.log('Invoice validation:', result);
}

// Bad: Test everything at once
function testEverything() {
  // 500 lines of test code
}
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Working with Sentinel Code Review

**Sentinel automatically reviews your code for:**
- Security vulnerabilities (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS)
- Accessibility issues (missing alt text, labels)
- Code quality problems (console.logs, missing error handling)

**When committing code:**
```bash
# Sentinel runs automatically
git add .
git commit -m "Implement criteria #4: Invoice validation"

# If Sentinel blocks with CRITICAL issues:
# 1. Read the error message carefully
# 2. Fix the security issue
# 3. Commit again

# Only bypass in emergencies (rarely!)
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

**Understanding Sentinel feedback:**
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Security risk - must fix before merging
- üü† **HIGH**: Major issue - fix before release
- üü° **MEDIUM**: Code quality - address in next sprint
- üü¢ **LOW**: Nice-to-have - backlog item

**LCT-Specific Security Rules Sentinel Enforces:**
1. No hardcoded API keys or passwords
2. Patient data (PHI) must be encrypted
3. Financial calculations validated server-side only
4. All user inputs sanitized before use
5. Error messages don't expose sensitive data
6. Proper error handling on all async operations

**Example - Sentinel-approved code:**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Sentinel approves this
async function processInvoice(invoiceData) {
  try {
    // Validate inputs (prevents injection)
    if (!invoiceData || typeof invoiceData.amount !== 'number') {
      throw new Error('Invalid invoice data');
    }

    // Server-side validation only (Criteria #4)
    const validated = await validateWithLCTSystem(invoiceData);

    return { success: true, result: validated };
  } catch (error) {
    // Safe error handling (no data exposure)
    console.error('Invoice processing failed');
    return { success: false, error: 'Processing failed' };
  }
}

// ‚ùå BAD - Sentinel will block this
const API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123"; // Hardcoded secret!
function processInvoice(data) {
  // No validation!
  return fetch(`/api?data=${data}`); // No error handling!
}
```
