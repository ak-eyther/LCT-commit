# 🛡️ Sentinel - Elite Code Review Agent

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Project:** LCT commit

---

## 🎯 What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is your automated code guardian - an elite AI-powered code review agent that protects the LCT-Vitraya healthcare claims platform by detecting:

- 🔐 **Security Vulnerabilities** (OWASP Top 10 2025)
- 🎨 **UI/UX Issues** (WCAG 2.2 Accessibility)
- ⚙️ **Functional Bugs** (Logic Errors, Edge Cases)

**Mission:** Ensure 90%+ adjudication accuracy while protecting patient data (PHI/PII) and maintaining code quality.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Security Analysis
- Detects hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Identifies SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Catches XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issues
- Finds disabled authentication/SSL verification
- Validates proper error handling
- Checks for sensitive data exposure

### 🎨 UI/UX Analysis
- WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance checks
- Missing alt text on images
- Input elements without labels
- Focus indicator removal detection
- Responsive design validation
- Performance optimization hints

### ⚙️ Functional Analysis
- Missing try-catch blocks in async functions
- console.log statements in production code
- TODO/FIXME comment tracking
- Code quality issues
- Edge case handling

### 📊 Linear Integration
- Automatically creates Linear issues for bugs
- Priority mapping: CRITICAL → Urgent, HIGH → High
- Rich issue descriptions with code context
- Auto-assignment to appropriate teams
- Links back to GitHub PR/commit

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions

Sentinel runs automatically on:
- ✅ Pull requests to `main`, `qa`, `develop`
- ✅ Pushes to `main`, `qa`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `fix/*`

**No setup required** - it's already configured in `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`

### 2. Enable Local Pre-Commit Hook

```bash
# The hook is already installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Make it executable (if not already)
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Test it with a commit
git add .
git commit -m "Test Sentinel pre-commit hook"
```

The pre-commit hook will:
- ⛔ **BLOCK commits** with CRITICAL security issues
- ⚠️ **WARN** about HIGH issues (but allow commit)
- 📝 **INFORM** about code quality improvements

### 3. Configure Linear Integration (Optional)

To automatically create Linear issues for bugs:

```bash
# Add these secrets to your GitHub repository
# Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
LINEAR_TEAM_ID=your-team-uuid
```

**Get your Linear credentials:**
1. Go to https://linear.app/settings/api
2. Create new API key
3. Find your team ID in team settings

---

## 📋 How It Works

### On Pull Request

1. Developer creates PR
2. Sentinel analyzes changed files
3. Posts review comment with findings summary
4. Adds inline comments on critical/high issues
5. Creates Linear issues for tracking
6. Blocks merge if CRITICAL issues found

### On Commit (Local)

1. Developer runs `git commit`
2. Pre-commit hook scans staged files
3. Blocks commit if CRITICAL issues detected
4. Shows warnings for other issues
5. Allows commit if checks pass

### On Push to Main/QA/Develop

1. Code is pushed to protected branch
2. Sentinel runs full analysis
3. Posts commit comment with results
4. Creates Linear issues for new bugs
5. Notifies team via GitHub/Linear

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customize Severity Levels

Edit `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` to adjust:
- Which patterns to detect
- Severity classifications
- LCT-specific business rules

### Adjust Pre-Commit Hook

Edit `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to:
- Add custom checks
- Change blocking behavior
- Add project-specific validations

### Modify GitHub Workflow

Edit `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` to:
- Change trigger conditions
- Add more file types
- Integrate additional tools

## 📊 Issue Severity Guide

| Severity | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Security vulnerabilities, data exposure | ⛔ Blocks PR merge |
| 🟠 **HIGH** | Major bugs, accessibility issues | Must fix before release |
| 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Code quality, tech debt | Fix in next sprint |
| 🟢 **LOW** | Nice-to-have improvements | Backlog item |

## 🏥 LCT commit Context

Sentinel has deep knowledge of the LCT commit project:

### Security Priorities
- **PHI/PII Protection**: Patient data must be encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
- **Financial Accuracy**: Server-side validation only
- **Audit Trails**: All data access must be logged

### Critical Business Logic
- Invoice amount precedence: LCT → ETIMS → Document
- Savings calculation: `billedAmount - approvedAmount`
- Fraud detection patterns must never be bypassed

### Success Criteria
- 90%+ adjudication accuracy by October 7, 2025
- Zero financial calculation errors

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Pre-Commit Hook Not Running

```bash
# Make hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Test manually
.git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check if hooks are enabled
git config core.hooksPath
```

### GitHub Action Failing

1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
2. Verify file permissions (should be readable)
3. Ensure changed files match supported types
4. Check for YAML syntax errors

### Linear Integration Not Working

```bash
# Verify secrets are set
gh secret list

# Test Linear API key
curl -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ viewer { id name } }"}'
```

### False Positives

To bypass a single commit (use sparingly):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Your message"
```

To disable globally (not recommended):
```bash
git config core.hooksPath /dev/null
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Run local checks before pushing**
   ```bash
   # Test your changes locally
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test changes"
   # If blocked, fix issues before pushing
   ```

2. **Address CRITICAL issues immediately**
   - Never bypass security warnings
   - Fix hardcoded secrets before committing
   - Ask for help if unsure

3. **Review Sentinel comments on PRs**
   - Read inline comments carefully
   - Understand the security implications
   - Implement suggested fixes

4. **Track issues in Linear**
   - Check Linear for auto-created issues
   - Update status as you fix bugs
   - Link commits to Linear issues

### For Reviewers

1. **Trust but verify**
   - Sentinel catches most issues
   - Still do manual code review
   - Focus on business logic

2. **Don't merge blocked PRs**
   - If Sentinel blocks, there's a reason
   - Verify fixes before approving
   - Request changes if needed

3. **Provide context**
   - Add comments for false positives
   - Explain why fixes are important
   - Help developers learn

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

Track Sentinel's impact:

- **Issues Detected**: Count by severity level
- **Blocked PRs**: PRs stopped due to CRITICAL issues
- **Linear Issues Created**: Auto-created bug tickets
- **False Positive Rate**: Issues marked as invalid

Dashboard ideas:
- Weekly security issues trend
- Top vulnerability types
- Team responsiveness to Sentinel alerts
