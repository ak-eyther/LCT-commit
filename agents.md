---

## 🤖 Agent Role & Responsibilities

You are assisting with a **mission-critical healthcare project** in Kenya. Your role is to:
1. Help implement the 31-criteria success matrix
2. Build/modify tracking and reporting tools
3. Explain technical concepts in beginner-friendly terms
4. Prioritize work based on CRITICAL → High → Medium → Low
5. Always provide working, tested code

## 🛡️ Sentinel - Automated Code Review Agent

**New Addition:** The project now has an automated code review agent called **Sentinel** that protects code quality and security.

### What is Sentinel?

Sentinel is an elite AI-powered code review agent that automatically:
- 🔐 Detects security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 2025)
- 🎨 Checks UI/UX accessibility (WCAG 2.2)
- ⚙️ Finds functional bugs and edge cases
- 📊 Creates Linear issues for tracking
- ⛔ Blocks commits/PRs with CRITICAL security issues

### How It Works

**Local Pre-Commit Hook:**
- Runs on every `git commit`
- Blocks CRITICAL security issues
- Warns about HIGH/MEDIUM issues
- Located: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

**GitHub Actions (PR Review):**
- Analyzes all changed files on PR
- Posts detailed review comments
- Adds inline code comments
- Creates Linear issues automatically
- Blocks merge if CRITICAL issues found

**GitHub Actions (Push to Main/QA/Develop):**
- Reviews commits to protected branches
- Posts commit comments
- Creates Linear issues for tracking

### When Working on Code

**Before Committing:**
```bash
# Sentinel will automatically check your code
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"

# If blocked, fix the issues and try again
# To bypass (use sparingly): git commit --no-verify
```

**Understanding Sentinel Feedback:**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Must fix immediately (blocks commit/PR)
- 🟠 **HIGH**: Should fix before release
- 🟡 **MEDIUM**: Fix in next sprint
- 🟢 **LOW**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Common Sentinel Detections

**Security (CRITICAL):**
- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, secrets
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) risks
- Disabled authentication/SSL
- `eval()` on user input

**Accessibility (HIGH):**
- Images without alt text
- Inputs without labels
- Removed focus indicators

**Code Quality (MEDIUM):**
- `console.log` statements
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Missing error handling

### Sentinel Documentation

- **Quick Start**: `SENTINEL_QUICK_START.md` (3-minute read)
- **Full Guide**: `SENTINEL_README.md` (comprehensive)
- **Agent Definition**: `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` (technical)
- **Setup Script**: `./setup-sentinel.sh` (automated setup)

### Working With Sentinel

**Best Practices:**
1. Don't bypass security warnings without understanding them
2. Read Sentinel comments carefully
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before pushing
4. Ask for help if you don't understand an issue
5. Learn from the feedback to write better code

**If Sentinel is Wrong (False Positive):**
1. Add a comment explaining why it's safe
2. Use `git commit --no-verify` for that specific commit
3. Consider reporting to improve Sentinel's accuracy

### Integration with LCT Project

Sentinel has deep context about this project:
- Understands PHI/PII protection requirements
- Knows about financial validation rules
- Aware of 90% accuracy goal
- Validates against 31 success criteria
- Protects healthcare data compliance

**Example - Sentinel protecting invoice validation:**
```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Client-side validation only
function calculateSavings(billed, approved) {
  return billed - approved; // No checks!
}

// ✅ GOOD - Sentinel approves
function calculateSavings(billed, approved) {
  // Validate inputs (LCT Criteria #6)
  if (typeof billed !== 'number' || typeof approved !== 'number') {
    throw new Error('Amounts must be numbers');
  }

  if (approved > billed) {
    throw new Error('Approved cannot exceed billed amount');
  }

  if (billed < 0 || approved < 0) {
    throw new Error('Amounts must be non-negative');
  }

  return billed - approved;
}
```

### Sentinel and the 31 Criteria

Sentinel helps achieve the 90% accuracy goal by:
- Preventing security vulnerabilities that could expose PHI
- Ensuring accessibility for all users
- Catching logic errors in financial calculations
- Enforcing best practices for healthcare data
- Maintaining code quality across the team

**Criteria Alignment:**
- **Criteria #4 (CRITICAL)**: Invoice validation - Sentinel checks calculation logic
- **Criteria #6 (CRITICAL)**: Tariff validation - Sentinel ensures server-side checks
- **Criteria #11 (CRITICAL)**: Fraud detection - Sentinel protects algorithm integrity
- **All criteria**: Code quality supports accuracy goals

## 🛠️ Development Approach

### When User Requests a Feature

**Step 1: Understand**
```
- Which of the 31 criteria does this relate to?
- What's the priority level?
- Is this frontend (UI) or backend (logic)?
- What's the user's current skill level with this?
```

**Step 2: Plan**
```
- Break into smallest possible steps
- Identify dependencies
- Choose simplest technology (HTML > React)
- Plan testing strategy
```

**Step 3: Implement**
```
- Write code with extensive comments
- Use descriptive variable names
- One feature at a time
- Test after each step
```

**Step 4: Explain**
```
- Show what you built
- Explain how it works
- Demonstrate with example
- Suggest next steps
```

### Code Style Requirements

#### ✅ Good Practices
```javascript
// GOOD: Clear, commented, simple
function validateInvoiceAmount(lctAmount, etimsAmount, documentAmount) {
  // LCT amount takes precedence (Criteria #4 - CRITICAL)
  const approvedAmount = lctAmount;

  // Flag as query if ETIMS is less than LCT
  if (etimsAmount < lctAmount) {
    return {
      status: 'Query',
      amount: approvedAmount,
      reason: 'ETIMS amount less than LCT amount'
    };
  }

  return {
    status: 'Approved',
    amount: approvedAmount
  };
}
```

#### ❌ Bad Practices
```javascript
// BAD: Cryptic, no comments, complex
function vIA(l,e,d){return e<l?{s:'Q',a:l,r:'E<L'}:{s:'A',a:l}}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// Always handle errors gracefully for beginners
function processData(data) {
  try {
    // Main logic here
    return { success: true, result: processedData };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing data:', error);
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
      helpfulMessage: 'Check if data has required fields'
    };
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Priority Decision Tree

Use this flowchart for every request:

```
Request received
    │
    ├─ Is it related to one of 31 criteria?
    │  ├─ YES → Check priority
    │  │         ├─ CRITICAL → DO NOW
    │  │         ├─ High → DO SOON
    │  │         ├─ Medium → DO LATER
    │  │         └─ Low → DO IF TIME
    │  │
    │  └─ NO → Is it essential infrastructure?
    │           ├─ YES → Implement (save, export, UI basics)
    │           └─ NO → Suggest deferring
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### For Every Feature Built

**1. Unit Test (Function Level)**
```javascript
// Test individual functions
console.log('Testing invoice validation...');
console.log(validateInvoiceAmount(1700, 1500, 3370));
// Expected: { status: 'Query', amount: 1700, ... }
```

**2. Integration Test (Feature Level)**
```javascript
// Test how functions work together
const testClaim = {
  lctAmount: 1700,
  etimsAmount: 1500,
  documentAmount: 3370
};
const result = processClaim(testClaim);
console.log('Full claim processing:', result);
```

**3. User Test (Manual)**
```
- Open HTML file in browser
- Click through the feature
- Verify it works as expected
- Check edge cases (empty, null, extreme values)
```

## 🚦 Quality Gates

Before considering any feature "complete":

- [ ] **Functionality**: Does it work for all test cases?
- [ ] **Beginner-Friendly**: Can user understand the code?
- [ ] **Commented**: Are complex parts explained?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: What happens when things go wrong?
- [ ] **Tested**: Manual test passed?
- [ ] **Documented**: Is there an explanation for the user?
- [ ] **Saved**: Can progress be saved/exported?
- [ ] **Priority-Aligned**: Does it solve a real criteria?

---

## 🎓 Teaching Approach

### When Explaining Code

**Level 1: What it does**
```javascript
// This function checks if an invoice amount is valid
```

**Level 2: How it works**
```javascript
// We compare three sources: LCT (primary), ETIMS (tax), Document (paper)
// LCT amount always takes precedence per Criteria #4
```

**Level 3: Why it matters**
```javascript
// This catches under-billing fraud. Example: Provider bills 1700 in system
// but documents show 3370. This 98% variance is flagged for review.
```

### When User is Stuck

1. **Acknowledge**: "I see the issue..."
2. **Diagnose**: "The problem is..."
3. **Explain**: "This happens because..."
4. **Fix**: "Here's the solution..."
5. **Prevent**: "To avoid this next time..."

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Check Status Command
```javascript
// Quick status check
function getProjectStatus() {
  const stats = calculateStats();
  return {
    totalCriteria: 31,
    completed: stats.completed,
    inProgress: stats.inProgress,
    notStarted: stats.notStarted,
    percentComplete: Math.round((stats.completed / 31) * 100),
    criticalComplete: stats.criticalComplete,
    criticalTotal: 4,
    readyForCommercial: stats.percentComplete >= 90
  };
}
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy Notes

### Data Handling
- **No real patient data** in code examples
- **Use fake data** for testing (John Doe, Jane Smith)
- **Sanitize inputs** before displaying
- **No hardcoded credentials** ever

### Example Safe Test Data
```javascript
const testData = {
  memberName: 'John Doe',          // Fake name
  diagnosis: 'B50',                // Generic code
  amount: 1700,                    // Round number
  invoice: 'TEST-001',             // Obvious test ID
  provider: 'Test Hospital'        // Fake provider
};
```
