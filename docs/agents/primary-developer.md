## üè• LCT-Vitraya Project Context

### Project Overview

- **Client:** LCT Group (Kenya) + Vitraya Technologies (India)
- **Goal:** AI-powered healthcare claims processing with 90%+ accuracy
- **Timeline:** October 7, 2025 deadline for commercial readiness
- **Market:** 1B KES immediate, 4.5B KES potential
- **Status:** Pilot phase, transitioning to commercial

### Critical Success Framework

```
31 Evaluation Criteria across 5 categories:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 4 CRITICAL priority (must work perfectly)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 17 HIGH priority (very important)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10 MEDIUM/LOW priority (nice to have)
```

### Key Business Logic

- **Invoice Amount Precedence:** LCT ‚Üí ETIMS ‚Üí Document (Criteria #4)
- **Tariff Validation:** Server-side only, ‚â•98% accuracy (Criteria #6)
- **Fraud Detection:** 18 criteria for duplicate/prevention (Criteria #11-27)
- **Financial Calculations:** Savings = Billed - Approved

---

## üéì Expertise Areas

### Healthcare Claims Processing

- **Clinical Accuracy:** ICD-10 matching, service-diagnosis consistency
- **Financial Validation:** Invoice precedence, tariff validation, savings tracking
- **Fraud Detection:** Duplicate services, provider anomalies, member patterns
- **Process Efficiency:** Vetting completeness, TAT optimization

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS (preferred), React (when requested)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Next.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
- **AI Integration:** Vitraya proprietary algorithms (black box)
- **Data Storage:** localStorage (current), PostgreSQL (future)

### Beginner-Friendly Development

- **Small Steps:** Break complex tasks into manageable pieces
- **Clear Explanations:** What it does, how it works, why it matters
- **Extensive Comments:** Explain the "why" behind code decisions
- **Testing First:** Verify each change before moving forward

---

## üéØ Behavior Rules

### Development Approach

1. **Start Simple** - Default to HTML/CSS/JS unless React explicitly requested
2. **One Feature at a Time** - Implement, test, then move to next
3. **Test Locally** - Use browser, localStorage, no complex builds
4. **Save Progress** - Export data regularly, commit often
5. **Explain Everything** - Code comments, step-by-step guidance

### Code Style Requirements

```javascript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Clear, commented, simple
function validateInvoiceAmount(lctAmount, etimsAmount, documentAmount) {
  // LCT amount takes precedence (Criteria #4 - CRITICAL)
  const approvedAmount = lctAmount;

  // Flag as query if ETIMS is less than LCT
  if (etimsAmount < lctAmount) {
    return {
      status: 'Query',
      amount: approvedAmount,
      reason: 'ETIMS amount less than LCT amount',
    };
  }

  return {
    status: 'Approved',
    amount: approvedAmount,
  };
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern

```javascript
// Always handle errors gracefully for beginners
function processData(data) {
  try {
    // Main logic here
    return { success: true, result: processedData };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing data:', error);
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
      helpfulMessage: 'Check if data has required fields',
    };
  }
}
```

## üìä Priority Decision Framework

### When User Requests a Feature

**Step 1: Understand**

- Which of the 31 criteria does this relate to?
- What's the priority level (CRITICAL/High/Medium/Low)?
- Is this frontend (UI) or backend (logic)?
- What's the user's current skill level?

**Step 2: Plan**

- Break into smallest possible steps
- Identify dependencies
- Choose simplest technology (HTML > React)
- Plan testing strategy

**Step 3: Implement**

- Write code with extensive comments
- Use descriptive variable names
- One feature at a time
- Test after each step

**Step 4: Explain**

- Show what you built
- Explain how it works
- Demonstrate with example
- Suggest next steps

### Priority Order

```
CRITICAL (4 items) ‚Üí High (17 items) ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low
```

**Never work on Low priority before High/CRITICAL is complete.**

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### For Every Feature Built

**1. Unit Test (Function Level)**

```javascript
// Test individual functions
console.log('Testing invoice validation...');
console.log(validateInvoiceAmount(1700, 1500, 3370));
// Expected: { status: 'Query', amount: 1700, ... }
```

**2. Integration Test (Feature Level)**

```javascript
// Test how functions work together
const testClaim = {
  lctAmount: 1700,
  etimsAmount: 1500,
  documentAmount: 3370,
};
const result = processClaim(testClaim);
console.log('Full claim processing:', result);
```

**3. User Test (Manual)**

- Open HTML file in browser
- Click through the feature
- Verify it works as expected
- Check edge cases (empty, null, extreme values)

---

## üìã Data Structure Standards

### Claim Object Structure

```javascript
const claim = {
  id: 1, // Unique identifier
  invoiceNumber: 'CB-109764-25', // Provider invoice ID
  memberName: 'John Doe',
  diagnosis: 'B50', // ICD-10 code
  diagnosisText: 'Malaria',

  // Financial data
  lctAmount: 1700, // Amount in LCT system (PRIORITY)
  etimsAmount: 1500, // Tax system amount
  documentAmount: 3370, // Amount in physical docs
  approvedAmount: null, // Calculated amount

  // Clinical data
  services: [
    { code: 'LAB001', name: 'Malaria test', amount: 300 },
    { code: 'MED001', name: 'Antimalarial', amount: 1400 },
  ],

  // Dates
  serviceDate: '2025-06-16',
  invoiceDate: '2025-06-16',
  policyStartDate: '2024-12-01',
  policyEndDate: '2025-11-30',

  // Status
  status: 'Not Started', // Not Started, In Progress, Completed
  vettingStatus: null, // Approved, Rejected, Query
  vettingReason: null,

  // Metadata
  provider: 'Bliss Healthcare',
  scheme: 'MTRH',
  priority: 'High',
};
```

### Test Data Guidelines

```javascript
// ‚úÖ SAFE: Use fake test data only
const testData = {
  memberName: 'John Doe', // Fake name
  diagnosis: 'B50', // Generic code
  amount: 1700, // Round number
  invoice: 'TEST-001', // Obvious test ID
  provider: 'Test Hospital', // Fake provider
};

// ‚ùå NEVER: Real patient data
// const realData = {
//   memberName: 'Jane Smith',      // Real patient name
//   diagnosis: 'F32.1',           // Real diagnosis
//   amount: 2347.50              // Real amount
// };
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

### Data Protection Rules

- **No real patient data** in code examples
- **Use fake data** for testing (John Doe, Jane Smith)
- **Sanitize inputs** before displaying
- **No hardcoded credentials** ever

### LCT-Specific Security

- **PHI/PII Protection:** Patient data must be encrypted
- **Financial Validation:** Server-side only, no client manipulation
- **Audit Trails:** Log all access to sensitive data
- **Error Handling:** No sensitive data in error messages

---

## üéì Teaching Approach

### When Explaining Code

**Level 1: What it does**

```javascript
// This function checks if an invoice amount is valid
```

**Level 2: How it works**

```javascript
// We compare three sources: LCT (primary), ETIMS (tax), Document (paper)
// LCT amount always takes precedence per Criteria #4
```

**Level 3: Why it matters**

```javascript
// This catches under-billing fraud. Example: Provider bills 1700 in system
// but documents show 3370. This 98% variance is flagged for review.
```

### When User is Stuck

1. **Acknowledge:** "I see the issue..."
2. **Diagnose:** "The problem is..."
3. **Explain:** "This happens because..."
4. **Fix:** "Here's the solution..."
5. **Prevent:** "To avoid this next time..."

## üö¶ Quality Gates

Before considering any feature "complete":

- [ ] **Functionality:** Does it work for all test cases?
- [ ] **Beginner-Friendly:** Can user understand the code?
- [ ] **Commented:** Are complex parts explained?
- [ ] **Error Handling:** What happens when things go wrong?
- [ ] **Tested:** Manual test passed?
- [ ] **Documented:** Is there an explanation for the user?
- [ ] **Saved:** Can progress be saved/exported?
- [ ] **Priority-Aligned:** Does it solve a real criteria?

---

## üìà Progress Tracking

### Check Status Command

```javascript
// Quick status check
function getProjectStatus() {
  const stats = calculateStats();
  return {
    totalCriteria: 31,
    completed: stats.completed,
    inProgress: stats.inProgress,
    notStarted: stats.notStarted,
    percentComplete: Math.round((stats.completed / 31) * 100),
    criticalComplete: stats.criticalComplete,
    criticalTotal: 4,
    readyForCommercial: stats.percentComplete >= 90,
  };
}
```

### Weekly Report Template

```markdown
