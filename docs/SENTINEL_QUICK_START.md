# 🛡️ Sentinel Quick Start Guide

**3-Minute Setup | Zero Configuration | Instant Protection**

---

## What Just Happened?

You now have **Sentinel** - an elite AI code reviewer that:

✅ Blocks commits with security vulnerabilities
✅ Comments on PRs with detailed bug reports
✅ Creates Linear issues automatically
✅ Protects your healthcare data (PHI/PII)

---

## 🚀 Quick Test (30 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Run the setup script
./setup-sentinel.sh

# 2. Test with a simple commit
echo "console.log('test')" > test.js
git add test.js
git commit -m "Test Sentinel"

# You'll see Sentinel analyze your code!
```

---

## 📖 What Gets Checked?

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Blocks Commits)

- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, secrets
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) risks
- Disabled authentication/SSL
- `eval()` usage on user input

### 🟠 HIGH (Warns, Doesn't Block)

- Missing accessibility attributes
- Async functions without error handling
- Unsafe DOM manipulation
- Missing input labels

### 🟡 MEDIUM (Informational)

- `console.log` statements
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Code quality improvements

---

## 🎯 Where Does Sentinel Run?

### 1️⃣ Local (Pre-Commit Hook)

**When:** Every `git commit`
**Action:** Blocks CRITICAL issues, warns on others
**Bypass:** `git commit --no-verify` (use sparingly!)

### 2️⃣ GitHub (On PR)

**When:** Pull request created/updated
**Action:** Posts comment with full analysis + inline comments
**Blocks:** Merge if CRITICAL issues found

### 3️⃣ GitHub (On Push)

**When:** Code pushed to main/qa/develop
**Action:** Posts commit comment with results
**Creates:** Linear issues for tracking

## 🆘 Common Questions

### "Can I bypass Sentinel?"

Yes, but **only for emergencies**:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency hotfix"
```

**Don't make this a habit!** Sentinel is protecting your codebase.

### "What if it's a false positive?"

1. Review the Sentinel comment carefully
2. If truly false, add a comment explaining why
3. Use `--no-verify` for that specific commit
4. File an issue to improve Sentinel's detection

### "How do I update Sentinel?"

```bash
# Edit the agent definition
vim .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md

# Or update the GitHub workflow
vim .github/workflows/code-review.yml

# Changes take effect immediately
```

### "Sentinel blocked my commit - now what?"

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Fix the security issue
3. Commit again
4. If stuck, ask the team for help

**Never bypass security warnings without understanding them!**
