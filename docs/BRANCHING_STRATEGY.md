# Branching Strategy - LCT commit

## üìã Overview

This project uses a **simple, lightweight Git workflow with QA gate** optimized for small teams working on HTML applications with Vercel deployment and AI-powered code review.

**Philosophy:** Keep it simple, but safe. This is a single HTML file project, not a complex application. The QA branch adds a quality gate with automated AI review (Sentinel + CodeRabbit) before production, without adding complexity.

---

## üå≥ Branch Structure

### Simple Structure

```
main (production)
  ‚Üë
  QA (pre-production testing & AI review)
  ‚Üë
feature/*, fix/* (short-lived, 1-2 days max)
```

**Enhanced with QA!** Simple workflow with quality gate before production.

### Branch Descriptions

| Branch      | Purpose                          | Deploys To                 | Protected   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| `main`      | Production code                  | Vercel Production          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional |
| `QA`        | Pre-production testing & AI review | Vercel Preview (QA)      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional |
| `feature/*` | New features                     | Local/Preview              | ‚ùå No       |
| `fix/*`     | Bug fixes                        | Local/Preview              | ‚ùå No       |

## üöÄ Daily Workflow

### Starting New Work

```bash
# Pull latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/duplicate-detection

# Or for bug fix
git checkout -b fix/export-csv-bug
```

### Branch Naming Convention

Format: `<type>/<short-description>`

**Types:**

- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `refactor/` - Code cleanup

**Examples:**

```
feature/tariff-validation
feature/fraud-detection-ui
fix/invoice-validation-bug
fix/export-csv-encoding
docs/update-readme
refactor/cleanup-css
```

### Working on Your Branch

```bash
# Make changes and test
# Open lct-tracker-html.html in browser to test

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add invoice validation logic

Implements criteria #4 (CRITICAL) - Invoice amount precedence.
LCT amount takes priority over ETIMS and Document amounts.

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/duplicate-detection
```

### Merging to QA for Testing

**Recommended workflow with QA gate:**

```bash
# After testing locally
git checkout QA
git pull origin QA
git merge feature/duplicate-detection
git push origin QA

# AI reviewers (Sentinel, CodeRabbit) automatically review
# Test on QA environment
# Wait for AI review results
```

### Promoting QA to Main (Production)

**After successful QA testing:**

```bash
# Merge QA to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge QA
git push origin main

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/duplicate-detection
git push origin --delete feature/duplicate-detection
```

**Alternative: Pull Request Workflow (Recommended for team work)**

```bash
# Push your feature branch
git push origin feature/duplicate-detection

# Create PR to QA via GitHub web interface
# AI Review (Sentinel + CodeRabbit) runs automatically
# After approval ‚Üí Merge to QA

# Test on QA environment

# Create PR from QA to main
# Final review ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Deploy to production
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### DO ‚úÖ

- **Test in browser before committing** - Open HTML file, verify it works
- **Merge to QA before main** - Always use the quality gate
- **Wait for AI review results** - Check Sentinel and CodeRabbit feedback
- **Keep branches short-lived** - 1-2 days max
- **One feature per branch** - Don't mix unrelated changes
- **Write clear commit messages** - Future you will thank you
- **Delete merged branches** - Keep repo clean
- **Commit often** - Small commits are easier to track

### DON'T ‚ùå

- **Commit broken code** - Always test first
- **Skip QA branch** - Never merge feature branches directly to main
- **Ignore AI review comments** - Fix critical and high priority issues
- **Mix multiple features** - One thing at a time
- **Use vague messages** - "fix stuff" tells us nothing
- **Let branches go stale** - Merge or delete within days
- **Force push to main or QA** - Never do this

---

## üîç Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Quick Fix

```bash
# For small urgent fixes
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/typo-in-label

# Fix the typo
# Test in browser

git add .
git commit -m "fix: Correct typo in criteria label"
git push origin fix/typo-in-label

# Merge to QA for AI review
git checkout QA
git pull origin QA
git merge fix/typo-in-label
git push origin QA

# After AI review passes, merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge QA
git push origin main
```

### Scenario 2: Working on Multiple Features

```bash
# Feature 1
git checkout -b feature/tariff-validation
# Work and commit

# Switch to Feature 2 (without finishing Feature 1)
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/fraud-detection
# Work and commit

# Switch back to Feature 1
git checkout feature/tariff-validation
# Continue work
```

### Scenario 3: Main Has New Changes

```bash
# Update your feature branch with latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### Scenario 4: QA Testing Before Production

```bash
# Merge feature to QA for testing
git checkout QA
git pull origin QA
git merge feature/tariff-validation
git push origin QA

# Wait for AI reviewers (Sentinel, CodeRabbit) to complete
# Test on QA environment
# If issues found, fix them on the feature branch and repeat

# Once QA passes, promote to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge QA
git push origin main
```

### Scenario 5: Oops, Broke Production

```bash
# Quick revert
git checkout main
git revert <bad-commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Or create fix
git checkout -b fix/urgent-production-fix
# Fix the issue
# Test thoroughly
git push origin fix/urgent-production-fix
# Merge to QA first, then main
```

### Scenario 6: Sync QA with Main

```bash
# If main has hotfixes that QA doesn't have
git checkout QA
git pull origin QA
git merge main
git push origin QA
```

## üöÄ Deployment Flow

```
Developer ‚Üí feature/xxx
              ‚Üì
           Test locally (open HTML in browser)
              ‚Üì
           Push to GitHub
              ‚Üì
           Merge to QA ‚Üí Vercel Preview (QA) + AI Review (Sentinel, CodeRabbit)
              ‚Üì
           Test on QA environment
              ‚Üì
           Merge to main ‚Üí Vercel Production (auto-deploy)
```

### Vercel Integration

- **Main branch** ‚Üí Automatically deploys to production
- **QA branch** ‚Üí Deploys to QA preview environment for testing
- **Feature branches** ‚Üí Can preview if needed (optional)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection (Optional)

For `main` and `QA` branches, you CAN add protection (but not required for solo work):

**Minimal Protection:**

- ‚úÖ Require pull request before merging (optional)
- ‚ùå Approvals: Not needed for solo work
- ‚úÖ Do not allow force push (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass (Sentinel, CodeRabbit reviews)

**How to enable:**

- Go to: https://github.com/ak-eyther/LCT-commit/settings/branches
- Add rule for `main` and `QA`
- Enable only what you need

---

## üìä Branch Lifecycle

```
Created ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Push ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Delete
   ‚Üì        ‚Üì      ‚Üì      ‚Üì       ‚Üì       ‚Üì
  1hr    1-2 days  5min   1min   1min   1min
```

**Target Timeline:**

- Feature development: 1-2 days
- Testing: 5 minutes (open HTML in browser)
- Merge: Fast
- **Total cycle: < 3 days**

## üìö Quick Reference

```bash
# Daily workflow with QA gate
git checkout main                # Start from main
git pull origin main             # Get latest
git checkout -b feature/name     # Create branch
# [work and test in browser]
git add .                        # Stage changes
git commit -m "message"          # Commit
git push origin feature/name     # Push

# Merge to QA for testing
git checkout QA
git pull origin QA
git merge feature/name
git push origin QA
# Wait for AI review (Sentinel, CodeRabbit)
# Test on QA environment

# Promote QA to main (after testing passes)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge QA
git push origin main

# Cleanup
git branch -d feature/name       # Delete local
git push origin --delete feature/name  # Delete remote

# Check status
git status                       # Current state
git branch                       # List branches
git log --oneline -5             # Recent commits
```

## üí° Why This QA-Enhanced Approach?

### Perfect for:

- ‚úÖ Single HTML file projects
- ‚úÖ Small teams (1-3 people)
- ‚úÖ Fast iteration needed
- ‚úÖ AI-powered code review (Sentinel, CodeRabbit)
- ‚úÖ Quality gate before production
- ‚úÖ Healthcare/financial applications requiring compliance
- ‚úÖ Projects where testing = opening file in browser

### Not suitable for:

- ‚ùå Large applications with complex build processes
- ‚ùå Teams of 10+ developers
- ‚ùå Complex multi-environment pipelines

### Your LCT Project:

- üéØ Single HTML file
- üéØ LocalStorage (no database)
- üéØ No build process
- üéØ Test by opening in browser
- üéØ Small team
- üéØ Healthcare claims = compliance required
- üéØ AI-powered security & quality checks
- **‚úÖ Perfect fit for QA-enhanced workflow!**

### Why Add QA Branch?

1. **Automated AI Review**: Sentinel and CodeRabbit automatically review all code before production
2. **Security Compliance**: Healthcare PHI/PII requires security checks (OWASP Top 10)
3. **Linear Integration**: Issues auto-created from AI reviews for tracking
4. **Quality Gate**: Catch bugs before production without manual reviews
5. **LCT Requirement**: 90% accuracy target needs quality assurance

## üÜò Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

**"I committed to main by accident"**

```bash
# It's okay! Just revert
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

**"My branch is out of date"**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
```

**"I want to undo my last commit"**

```bash
# Undo but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo and discard changes (careful!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
